# Pipedream
Weird Hallucinating Loader

should base of smelly_vx's feverdream and also use pipes and have 2 processes map one executable in memory

should be position independent, which also means CRT

maybe use api hashing (tiger algo?) and implement weird encryption

maybe maybe also find a use of a rohrschach pattern generator- perhaps obfuscation??

test against elastic????

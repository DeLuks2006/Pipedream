# Pipedream
Weird Hallucinating Loader

should base of smelly_vx's feverdream 

and also **MAYBE** (idk if it would be bad) use pipes and have 2 processes map one executable in memory

should be kinda position independent, which also means CRT

RECURSIVE REFLECTIVE LOADERRR

maybe use api hashing (tiger algo?) and implement weird encryption

maybe maybe also find a use of a rohrschach pattern generator- perhaps obfuscation??

test against elastic????
